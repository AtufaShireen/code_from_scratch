1. Repo containing codes for DSA problems (from arrays to recursions), ML algorithms (from linear regression to diffusers). 
2. The Repo will include links or notes for important concepts not covered under ./good_links.txt and ./interview_questions.txt
3. The description for the solutions will be updated later.
4. Projects will be added later in another repo. 

Note to myself: You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Practice is to understand things clearly.
